Front End Development Libraries Projects - React/Redux Random Quote App

As part of the FreeCodeCamp Front End certification, this project aim to display random quote to the user. A twitter sharing option is available.

I choose to do it with React and React-Redux. For this kind of app, redux is not necessary, but I choose to use it as a learning process. It is my very first app with React and my first time using a state manager like Redux.

Other libraries : Bootstrap, FontAwesome

The quotes are from the API Quotable : https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable
